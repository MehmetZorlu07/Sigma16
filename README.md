# Sigma16
 
Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development environment. There is a digital circuit that implements the architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional hardware description language. Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the emulator and the circuit.
